# ðŸš€ Roadmap: Employee Lifecycle Management System (HRMS-Based, Advanced)

This roadmap outlines a structured, step-by-step approach to building an advanced HRMS dashboard with Redux for state management and asynchronous workflows.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Define the system structure.
- Identify key features and interactions.
- Plan state management and API integration.

### ðŸ›  Steps:

#### 1. Understand User Requirements:
HR Managers should be able to:
- View and manage employees.
- Track an employeeâ€™s lifecycle (Recruitment â†’ Onboarding â†’ Performance â†’ Offboarding).
- Receive notifications for important HR events.
- Filter and categorize employees based on department, status, and performance.

#### 2. Define Key State Slices:
- **Employee Profiles:** Personal details, job roles, salary, department, and status.
- **Departmental Data:** List of departments, department heads, and reporting structures.
- **Performance Metrics:** Ratings, feedback, promotions, and warnings.
- **Notifications:** Alerts for contract renewals, performance reviews, or pending onboarding tasks.

#### 3. Choose the Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React + Redux
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (with Redux Thunk/Redux Saga)
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Testing:** Jest & Redux DevTools

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Setting Up Redux & Global State

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Implement Redux store and structure state slices.
- Set up reducers for managing complex nested states.

### ðŸ›  Steps:

#### 1. Create the Redux Store:
- Set up Redux Toolkit with slices for employees, departments, performance, and notifications.

#### 2. Define Initial State & Reducers:
- **Employee Actions:** Add, edit, promote, terminate.
- **Department Updates:** Assign employees, change department heads.
- **Performance Updates:** Add reviews, update scores, track promotions.
- **Notifications:** Auto-generate alerts for deadlines and HR events.

#### 3. Integrate Redux into React:
- Wrap the application with Redux Provider.
- Connect state slices to relevant components.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Implementing Asynchronous Workflows

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Handle async API calls with Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
- Simulate real-world HR processes like scheduled reviews and contract renewals.

### ðŸ›  Steps:

#### 1. Set Up Middleware:
- Use Redux Thunk or Redux Saga to manage async actions.

#### 2. Fetch Employee Data:
- Simulate an API call to load employee profiles.
- Implement error handling for failed requests.

#### 3. Handle Time-Delayed Actions:
- Schedule notifications for contract expirations.
- Automate reminders for performance reviews.

#### 4. Integrate Performance Tracking:
- Fetch and update performance data asynchronously.
- Notify HR managers when employees become eligible for promotions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 4: Creating the Dynamic Dashboard

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Build an interactive UI for HR managers.
- Implement filtering, sorting, and search functionalities.

### ðŸ›  Steps:

#### 1. Design Dashboard Layout:
- Create sections for Employee Management, Performance Tracking, and Notifications.

#### 2. Implement Employee Filtering & Sorting:
- Allow HR managers to filter by department, role, performance score, and status.

#### 3. Display Real-Time Notifications:
- Use Redux state updates to trigger UI changes dynamically.

#### 4. Add Routing & Conditional Rendering:
- Use React Router to navigate between different HR modules.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 5: Testing & Debugging

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Ensure correct state transitions.
- Debug complex Redux interactions.

### ðŸ›  Steps:

#### 1. Use Redux DevTools:
- Track and debug state updates for better visibility.

#### 2. Write Unit & Integration Tests:
- Test reducers, actions, and API calls with Jest.

#### 3. Simulate Real-World Scenarios:
- Test different employee life cycles (e.g., onboarding â†’ promotion â†’ termination).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 6: Optimization & Deployment

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Optimize performance and deploy the HRMS system.

### ðŸ›  Steps:

#### 1. Optimize Redux State Management:
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- Use memoization for computed state values.

#### 2. Improve API Performance:
- Implement pagination for large employee datasets.

#### 3. Deploy the Application:
- Host on Netlify/Vercel (Frontend).
- Connect with a backend API (if required).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Deliverables:
- âœ… A fully functional HRMS dashboard with Redux-based state management.
- âœ… Real-time notifications for HR events.
- âœ… Asynchronous API integration for employee data and performance tracking.
- âœ… Interactive UI with filtering and dynamic routing.
